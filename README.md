CS2010 Lab 
So I finally managed to upload all the folders seperately in github after trials and errors. There might still be some errors though.
I built this project from CLion so there are some unnecessary folders/files like .idea,cmake-build-debug-CMakeLists.txt
To access the main code pls go to prog1/main.cpp so for the other 2 programs 
If you copy paste the main codes in Visual Studio or onlinegdb there shouldn't be any problem to run it except for the prog1 where we need to link 2 files
